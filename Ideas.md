### This readme will include all the things we want this project to be able to do, as well as possible ways/ideas to acheive them.
 (E.X. The project should be capable of moving independently. We could use motorized wheels or treads to move it.)
- Heavy/large enough to move dirt
- Either dig or push dirt out of the way
- The digger or ?dirt pusher? should be able to retract so it doesn't constantly dig trenches.
- System that contains seeds and drops them individually
- We can use a gear that rotates in a 
- Preferably treads for the wheels
- Measure distance
- Run automatically
- Battery accessible battery port and/or rechargeable 
- what will be the maximum seed size that our project can handle
- How big/powerful will our motots for our wheels or treads need to be
- Can move over rougher terrain
- Can aviod larger obstacles 
- possibly has the movement behavior of a Roomba
- possibly a way to right itself if it is flipped
- accessable seed container needs to be easily refilled
- uses gps to remain in designated zone
