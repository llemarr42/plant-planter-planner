## September

### Sept 12-16 (Week #4)
#### What did we work on?

We worked on doing research and looking at a lot of different options for each thing. We also made a rough schedule of what we are hoping to complete and when.

#### What decisions were made?

We decided that treads would be better for our planter.

#### What new resources did we find?

#### What new issues were discovered?

We have a promblem that a lot of the different aspects that we would like to include but they are either too expensive or unfeasable for us too build from scratch.

#### What went well?

We were able to create a flushed out idea of our project and the sort of things that need to go into it.

#### What was difficult?

We struggled to find a design or premade product for track treads that we want to include. 

#### What is our plan for next week?

We plan to finish our preliminary research next Friday. We say preliminary because we are sure that things will change while we progress into this project.


### Sept 19-23 (Week #5)
#### What did we work on?

We worked on finalizing our preliminary research by looking more in depth at multple points of our project that we had an idea for, but no real research on. We also looked back on some things that we wanted to include and saw if they were feasible. We found and research alternate ways to acheive our requirements in ways that are more possible to acheive in a reasonable amount of time.

#### What decisions were made?

We decided on the schedule that we want to follow. We found that our original idea of pushing the dirt would be unlikely to be possible so we chose to use a auger to dig small holes instead. We also finalized a lot of the materials that we will use.

#### What new issues were discovered?

We wanted to use a plough sort of design to push dirt and and plant as our robot was moving, but we discovered that this is a terrible design. In terrain that has so much as a root or rock in the way our robot would be useless. This isn't even thinking of how hard it is to push dirt especially if it is packed. We had to find an entirely new way to dig up dirt and to get our seeds into the hole.

#### What went well?

We got a lot of research done and the things we discovered will helps us so that we aren't half way through our project when we discover that something won't work. We also were able to research every part of our project in at least some capacity.

#### What was difficult?

We had trouble finding the things we need that are within our budget,

#### What is our plan for next week?

We will have finished all our research and will have put it together in our project proposal.

### Sept 27-30 (Week #6)
#### What did we work on?

This week we finished our research and have a rough idea of everything we want to do. We are pretty much done with our project proposal other than images of our onshape prototype. We haven't finished it yet, but are working to finish it by Monday next week.

#### What decisions were made?

We decided on dispensing seeds with a gear.

#### What new resources did we find?

#### What new issues were discovered?

We still have a few questions about how things will work. Mainly on where everything will go. We also started wondering about how to get the seed into the hole after digging it. We brainstormed and came up with two. One being a hollow auger that the seed will go down once it's stopped digging. This will probably be what we do. The other option is to have the auger come back up and have some tube or funnel that the seed will go through to all in the hole.

#### What went well?

We were able to decide on an idea for every part of our project. 

#### What was difficult?

Figuring out the placement of everything inside of our project. It's also been a bit difficult picturing the actual size of our projects.

#### What is our plan for next week?

We will finish our rough prototype and then start moving into making actual CAD parts next week. Our first customer meeting will be next week as well.


## October

### Oct 3-7 (Week #7)
#### What new things did you learn or try this week?

We learned that our original idea will not work due to the lack of a market for it. We have changed our project to plany grape vines rather than seeds or trees. We need to have a way to store and plant saplings. This means adding a robotic arm to our project. This will take a bunch of time that we didn't really plan for, but I think we will still be able to do it.

#### What has been the most useful resource for your project and why? 

So far, the most useful has been our customer because we were able to really dial into what we are doing in our projects. We can now find more things that we want and need for our project.

#### What help can I offer to help you complete your Project Proposal Presentations?

Nothing as of right now. We have to change a few things, but I think we are ok on the presentation part.


### Oct 10-14 (Week #8)
#### What did we work on?

This week worked on our presentation and getting the robot arm ready, in terms of both design and functions needed. We also are starting to prepare our presentation for the project proposal.

#### What new resources did we find?

We found a bit more information on grapes and ideas for the robot arm. We also talked with Mr. Garcia to flush out ideas for the robot arm. 

#### What is our plan for next week?

Next week we will have presented the presenation and continue working on Onshape. 


### Oct 17-21 (Week #9)
#### What did we work on?

We were presenting our project proposal. We also continued on Onshape.

### Feb 21-24 (Week #25)
#### What did we work on?

This was already a short week, but with both of us being absent for at least a day, we barely got anything done. We have got things organized and screwed in tighter with the arm, as well as started the code. Nothing went wrong, but nothing was outstanding either. 

#### What is our plan for next week?

Our plan for next week is to continue with the code and work on the arm to be ready to print.


## March

### Feb 27- Mar 3 (Week #26)
#### What did we work on?

This week we were working on finalizing the last pieces of the arm. We also got the code working more.

#### What new issues were discovered?

Our first arm piece is a bit heavier than we anticipated. We are making the pieces even lighter than we originally planned in order to hopefully stop the arm from being too heavy. We also underestimated the amount of work the code would take.

#### What went well?

The coding went well this week. We were able to get one movement working and slow it down. It was moving really fast before, but we found a way to slow the movement down, which allowed for steadier movement. 

#### What was difficult?

We were hoping to have the arm printed this week in order to start fully building and coding. However, the 3D printer messed up while printing our last two pieces. This caused us to not be able to put the arm together, but gave us more time to work on code and documentation.

#### What is our plan for next week?

Our plan for next week is to get farther into our project. We will be putting together the last few pieces of the arm as well as finalizing, and hopefully printing the gripper. If this happens, we will be even closer to the next step of our project.




### Mar 6- 10 (Week #27)
#### What did we work on?

This week we worked on more code and putting together the next arm parts. 

#### What new issues were discovered?

We designed one of the middle arm parts with holes that were too small and difficult to put in the screw. While trying to fix it, by drilling bigger holes, we acidently broke off the piece. We didn't fully get a chance to come up with a solution, but we are trying to not 3D print again unless we really have to.

#### What went well?

We made more progress in the coding.

#### What is our plan for next week?

Next week we will continue to work on the code, finishing up the gripper, and figure out our next steps with the part we messed up.



### Mar 13- 16 (Week #28)
#### What did we work on?

We worked on fixing the last parts of the arm. We also fixed the code to where it now only runs if a button is pressed.

#### What decisions were made?

We decided to reprint the one piece of the arm. It was going to cause more trouble if we tried to fix the origibnal piece. 

#### What went well?

We were able to figure out why our button wasn't working. The other building that we did this week was also pretty succesful.

#### What is our plan for next week?

Next week we are going to continue putting the last parts of the arm together, continue working on the code, and hopefully work to get the gripper printed and put together.


### Mar 20- 24 (Week #29)
#### What did we work on?

After getting our reprinted piece, we put the whole arm together. Other than that, we worked on our end of Q3 presentation. 

#### What new issues were discovered?

Our arm might be a little too heavy, but we are trying to find ways to make it work.

#### What went well?

We were finally able to put our whole arm together and see it in front of us rather than on a screen.

#### What is our plan for next week?

Next week is going to be busy. Being the week before spring break and the last week of the quarter, we have to give our presentation next week. Not only that, but we want to finish the coding for the two new servos (at least working to a certain degree) as well as get the final design for the gripper. We would like to also get the gripper laser cut, but with the busy week that might not happen.


### Mar 27- 30 (Week #30)
#### What did we work on?

This week we worked on the code and the presentation for Q3.

#### What decisions were made?

We decided that the arm was the priority, even though we also wanted to put the arm on a working body with treads.

#### What new issues were discovered?

One of our servos isn't working properly. We are trying to figure out the problem before break.

#### What is our plan for next week?
Spring Break! When we get back, we will continue to work on testing and fonalizing our project.
