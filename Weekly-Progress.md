## September

### Sept 12-16 (Week #4)
#### What did we work on?

We worked on doing research and looking at a lot of different options for each thing. We also made a rough schedule of what we are hoping to complete and when.

#### What decisions were made?

We decided that treads would be better for our planter.

#### What new resources did we find?

#### What new issues were discovered?

We have a promblem that a lot of the different aspects that we would like to include but they are either too expensive or unfeasable for us too build from scratch.

#### What went well?

We were able to create a flushed out idea of our project and the sort of things that need to go into it.

#### What was difficult?

We struggled to find a design or premade product for track treads that we want to include. 

#### What is our plan for next week?

We plan to finish our preliminary research next Friday. We say preliminary because we are sure that things will change while we progress into this project.


### Sept 19-23 (Week #5)
#### What did we work on?

We worked on finalizing our preliminary research by looking more in depth at multple points of our project that we had an idea for, but no real research on. We also looked back on some things that we wanted to include and saw if they were feasible. We found and research alternate ways to acheive our requirements in ways that are more possible to acheive in a reasonable amount of time.

#### What decisions were made?

We decided on the schedule that we want to follow. We found that our original idea of pushing the dirt would be unlikely to be possible so we chose to use a auger to dig small holes instead. We also finalized a lot of the materials that we will use.

#### What new issues were discovered?

We wanted to use a plough sort of design to push dirt and and plant as our robot was moving, but we discovered that this is a terrible design. In terrain that has so much as a root or rock in the way our robot would be useless. This isn't even thinking of how hard it is to push dirt especially if it is packed. We had to find an entirely new way to dig up dirt and to get our seeds into the hole.

#### What went well?

We got a lot of research done and the things we discovered will helps us so that we aren't half way through our project when we discover that something won't work. We also were able to research every part of our project in at least some capacity.

#### What was difficult?

We had trouble finding the things we need that are within our budget,

#### What is our plan for next week?

We will have finished all our research and will have put it together in our project proposal.
