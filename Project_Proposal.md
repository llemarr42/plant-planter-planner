## Summary of Project Idea
### Identify the problem and your proposed solution.
The problem is deforestation by people and forest fires. Our proposed solution is a robot that can plant seeds, while avoiding tree stumps and other obstacles. 
### How does this improve the world, community, school?
This improves the world by allowing trees to be planted by a robot rather than a person or people spending hours replanting trees in huge areas.
### What are your essential and non-essential requirements?
#### Essential
- Either dig or push dirt out of the way 
  - Heavy/large enough to move dirt
  - The digger or dirt pusher should be able to retract so it doesn't constantly dig trenches.
- Run automatically
- Battery accessible battery port and/or rechargeable
- System that contains seeds and drops them individually
  - We can use a gear that rotates
  - Accessible seed container needs to be easily refilled
- Measure distance
- Movement
  - Preferably treads for the wheels
  - Can move over rougher terrain
  - Can avoid larger obstacles
  - Possibly has the movement behavior of a Roomba
#### Non-Essential
- Self - Correction
  - A  way to right itself if it is flipped
  - Distress signal if it gets stuck
#### Unanswered Question
- What will be the maximum seed size that our project can handle?
- How big/powerful will our motors for our wheels or treads need to be?
- How will you measure the success of meeting each requirement?


### Timeline
#### How do you plan on meeting each of your requirements?
#### In what order will you complete each step?
#### How much time do you anticipate each step will take (THIS IS IMPORTANT!)?


### Materials/Budget
#### What type of micro-controller do you plan on using?
#### What materials from the lab will you be able to use?
#### What materials and costs do you anticipate needing to complete the project?


### Deliverables
#### What will you be turning at the end of the year?
#### Do you plan on also submitting a Technical Report, Edited Video, or giving a Presentation?


### References
#### There are a hundred different ways to do references and I'm not going to tell you which one to use, but you need references and those should be cited within your paper.  If this proposal is any good, it will be rich in research and technical details.  Those will come from sources and those sources need to be cite
