## Summary of Project Idea
### Identify the problem and your proposed solution.
Currently there is a problem with the planting of grapes. The workers are underpaid and overworked. There is no process as of right now to make the planting of the grape saplings easier. Our project is to make a robot that will dig holes into the ground and plant the saplings gently to avoid damage to them. We will also need a system that will prevent the roots from drying out within the robot before theyâ€™re planted as well.
### How does this improve the world, community, school?
This improves the world by allowing grapes to be planted by a robot rather than a person or people spending hours planting in bigger areas.
### What are your essential and non-essential requirements?
#### Essential
- Digging a hole wide enough to fit the saplings
  - The digger should be able to retract so it doesn't constantly dig trenches.
- Robotic Arm
  - Needs to be able to move in two directions
  - Pick up the sapling.
- Movement
  - Preferably treads for the wheels
  - Can move over rougher terrain
- Have a system that prevents the saplings from drying out before they are planted
- Measure distance
- Run automatically
- Battery accessible battery port and/or rechargeable
#### Non-Essential
- Self - Correction
  - A  way to right itself if it is flipped
  - Distress signal if it gets stuck
#### Unanswered Question
- How big/powerful will our motors for our wheels or treads need to be?

### How will you measure the success of meeting each requirement?
- Success will be measured by how well each part works individually, but also as a part within the project as a whole.

## Timeline
### How do you plan on meeting each of your requirements?
- We plan on working on similar things at the same time, but not the same thing unless it is something big (for example the lasers or sensors). By doing this we can help each other if needed, but also get twice as much done. 
### In what order will you complete each step?
- We will do the CAD first and then work with the coding last. Finally, and most obviously, will be the building and testing.
### How much time do you anticipate each step will take (THIS IS IMPORTANT!)?
- We plan for the coding to only take about a month. We left the month of October and a bit of November for Onshape. November and December will be months for coding. Ideally we will have all of the coding done by the time we leave for winter break. Building will take place during January and February. The last week and a half of February and March are dedicated to testing.  April will be used for final testing and building. The later half of March is all open for anything. We could spend this time catching up on anything or doing extra stuff from our non essential list. May is all for documentation and presentations. We plan to have the project completed, working, and presented on May 19th.

## Materials/Budget
### What type of micro-controller do you plan on using?
- We are planning on using a raspberry pi as of right now.
### What materials from the lab will you be able to use?
- Rasp pi
- GPS Antenna
- Tetrix Batteries and Chargers
- NeveRest Motors
- Chain and Chain Sprockets
- Servos
- Modern Robotics Controllers
- 3D printed parts
- Metal parts
- Ultrasonic sensors
### What materials and costs do you anticipate needing to complete the project?
A lot of what we want to use in the lab, but is for the robotic team.  Another thing might be a dirt drill auger for the digging part of the project. So we might have to buy these for our own project.

## Deliverables
### What will you be turning at the end of the year?
- We will be turning in a project that can dig into the ground, plant a grape sapling, and cover it with dirt repeatedly without getting stuck.
### Do you plan on also submitting a Technical Report, Edited Video, or giving a Presentation?
- We will be giving a final presentation foir the submission part.
